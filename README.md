MrNom-libGDX
============

Mr. Nom is a [«snake» game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game) "wikipedia.org") created by [Mario Zechner](http://www.badlogicgames.com/ "Mario's Blog") as an example for his book [«Beginning Android Games»](http://www.apress.com/9781430230427 "Book info"). This derived version is a personal practice to learn about [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ "More info about libGDX").

This Mr. Nom version has a new feature from original Mr. Nom, when snakes eates a stain shits a poo that is an obstacle for a few seconds, eat a poo subtract 100 points from the score.
